# PCAtomography

The code is a python version of the algoritm for Principal Component Analyses (PCA) in Integral Field Unit (IFU) Spectrograph data cubes by Steiner et al. 2009 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.2266). It is particularly usefull for 'Intrumental Fingerprint' removal, a proceding explored by Menezes et al. 2014 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7078). The code is avalible at https://github.com/muryelgp/PCAtomography for download.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install ```PCAtomography```.
